      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>Discover the enchanting world of Hagrid, the gentle giant of Hogwarts! With a beard so wild, it's like a magical creature in itself. His fashion sense? Well, let's just say moleskin overcoats and boots are the height of wizarding chic. Despite his towering presence, he's a softie at heart, especially when it comes to his beloved creatures. Conversations with Hagrid are like a blend of heartfelt advice and the occasional mystery ingredient accidentally added to a potion. In a nutshell, he's the guy you want by your side in a magical mishap, as long as you don't mind a bit of dragon slobber.</p>
